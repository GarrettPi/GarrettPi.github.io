      <p class="blogPost" >Let me start out by saying thank you to anyone who found their way here.  Before today, I had never attempted to do anything with html or CSS.  I know this website is NOT much to look at right now but as my training progresses, I expect my skills and sense of web dev style will increase.  My Skill Distillery coding bootcamp begins on July 19th.  I encourage any interested parties in visiting again after that as I hope to regularly update and improve this blog and all the connected sites and resources.  Thanks again!<a href="post2.html"> Read more...</a></p>
